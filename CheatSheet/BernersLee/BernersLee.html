    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        He attended Sheen Mont Primary School, and then went on to attend south-west London's Emanuel School from
        1969 to <br/>1973. He studied at The Queens's Collage, Oxford from 1973 to 1976, where he received a
        first-class Bachelor of Arts degree <br/>in physics. While at university, Beners-Lee made a computer out
        of an old television set, wich he bought from a repair shop
    </p>
    <h2>The Internet</h2>
    <p>
        In 1984, he returned to <a id="link" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> as a fellow. In
        1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an <br/>opportunity to join
        hypertext with the Internet- 'I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNA
        ideas <br/>and ta-da!-the World Wide Web '. In 1990, he created not only the first wb browser  but also
        an editor and first web <br/>server. The first website, an explanation of the WWW concept, was
        published on 1990-12-20 - avalable to the Internet via the <br/>CERN network.
